    fl "That's what our reports say, sir."
    
    k "It's certainly true. Our friend, The King of Austria, confirmed it. He also sent a warning that the Duke of Florence will be asking us for immediate assistance soon."

    k "A request which, Our dearest friend, the King of Austria, advises against accepting."

    fl "If your majesty thinks so much of his love and wisdom, then that should be sufficient guidance."

    k "Indeed it has. I've decided to deny the Duke of Florence before he even arrives."

    k "That said, if any of our gentlemen plan to go fight in this war, then they may fight on either side."
    #not sure to show second lord or not
    sl "Our soldiers will be happy to hear that. They're itching to go and fight."

    k "Who is this who comes here?"

    fl "It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord. Young Betram."

    k "Young man, you look just like your father."

    k "Nature, being generous and meticulous, rather than hasty, has made you quite handsome."

    k "I hope that you've inherited your father's morality as well.
    
    k "Welcome to Paris!"

    b "You have my thanks, your majesty. I pledge my service to you."

    #show king, thoughtful
    k "If only I was as healthy as when your father and I were soldiers together."

    k "He wanted to rise the ranks of the military back then and got quite the reputation for bravery."

    k "Lasted a long time too."

    k "But age snuck up on us both. It gets us all eventually."

    k "It makes me feel better to talk of your father, though."

    k "In his youth he had the same wit that I see now in our young lords."

    k "But these youths today can joke until we stop listening before they'd ever swap their wits for honorable deeds."

    k "Like a true nobleman, your father had never had contempt nor bitterness in his pride, nor sharpness."

    k "When he did speak sharply, it was always to an equal. He always kept his honor and knew when it was right to speak out."

    k "Only when he could back up his words with action."

    k "He'd treat those below him as though they were better than they were."

    k "He'd bow to lowly soldiers, despite his rank and reputation, just as he'd bow to his superiors."

    k "The other soldiers were in awe of him, of his humility."

    k "That he'd humble himself to praise them, low as they were."

    k "These youngsters should look to him as a role model."

    k "If they did they'd see that they're going backwards in their manners these days."

    b "You do honor to his memory, sir, more richly than the words on his tomb do."

    b "His legacy lives on in your speech more than his epitaph."
    #king, emotional
    k "If only I were with him!"
    #king, thoughtful
    k "He'd always say-"
    k "Not to many people, mind you, but only to certain people he felt needed to hear it-"
    k "\"Let me not live\""
    k "-melancholy speeches often begin that way, once a fun night has come to an end-"
    k "\"Let me not live,\" he'd say, \"after my spirit has lost its fire, to stick around stifling the young, whose quick sense hate anything that is not new.\""
    k "\"All their thoughts lead only to getting new clothes. All their loyalties fade out before their new fashions.\""
    k "That is what he wish, and, now, I wish it too."
    k "Since I can no longer bring the wax or honey home, I'd quickly be tossed out of the hive, so the laboring bees have more room to work."

    sl "You are well loved, sir. Those that least show their love would miss you the most."
    #still thoughtful
    k "I hold an important place, yes."

    #king, sad/solemn
    k "Betram, how long has it been since the physician your father had died?"
    
    b "Six months ago now, my lord."

    k "If he were living I'd still try him."
    k "Give me a hand, Bertram." 
    k "The rest of the doctors have worn me out with their cures."
    k "Nature and sickness are fighting over me."
    k "But you are most welcome, Bertram. I count you as dear as a son to me."
    #Bertram, thoughtful
    b "I thank you, your majesty."
